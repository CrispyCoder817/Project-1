# Project-1: Wanderl[o]st
This is the first collaberative group assigmnent from the Full Stack Web Development [MSU Coding Boot Camp](https://bootcamp.msu.edu/coding/landing/?s=Google-Brand_RFull_&msg_cv_scta=4&msg_cv_stbn=1&msg_cv_fcta=1&fqvar1=3&dki=Learn%20Coding&pkw=msu%20coding%20bootcamp&pcrid=471460105653&pmt=e&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GGL%7CMICHIGAN-STATE-UNIVERSITY%7CSEM%7CCODING%7C-%7COFL%7C_RFull_%7CALL%7CBRD%7CEXACT%7CCore%7CBootcamp&utm_term=msu%20coding%20bootcamp&s=google&k=msu%20coding%20bootcamp&utm_adgroupid=106134459970&utm_locationphysicalms=9016918&utm_matchtype=e&utm_network=g&utm_device=c&utm_content=471460105653&utm_placement=&gclid=Cj0KCQiA-OeBBhDiARIsADyBcE7Y_HuK3nbJPvfuQNXFO-pcYTApJovFYDJxTBtxpXeIn_4tCA74fnYaAqoAEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). Our group was tasked with creating a fully functional application and presenting it to our peers.

## Project Acceptance Criteria
* Must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* Must be deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
* Must be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Needs to utilize at least two server-side APIs.
* Uses modals (no alerts, confirms, or prompts).
* Must use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Should be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* The repository should be clean and meet quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* There should be a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Our Vision
Our group shares a common love of exploring the ourdoors and hiking. As we shared stories of our separate adventures wandering the wilds of this world, we quickly realized that we've all experienced getting lost and accidentally roaming off trail. Despite the use of trail guide books and provided park pamplets there's still plenty of room for one to get lost while hiking. Especially if a trail systems isn't properly marked or lacks signage. It became clear that we wanted to build an application that would provide hiking trail maps and accurate weather updates. 

## Technology Utilized
This application was built using dynamic HTML, CSS, and is powered by JavaScript. We chose to utilize the CSS framework [Foundation](https://get.foundation/) by ZURB Inc. For the weather reports we used the API [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/). To find trail maps we used the API [Michigan DNR Designated Hiking Pathways](https://gis-midnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/3d190eb423fa4e578049faf36654a8ab_1/data?geometry=-123.954%2C38.557%2C-50.873%2C49.561).

## Future Developement
After a long day of hiking and exploring adventurers alway look forward to a good meal and a safe comfortable place to sleep. In the future we'd like this application to include information for nearby lodging (hotels, motels, airbnb, etc) and local dinning options.
